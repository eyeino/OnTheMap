# OnTheMap
Shows a map of Udacity students around the globe

## What is OnTheMap?
### It shows you other students' locations
OnTheMap shows you a map of all Udacity students around the world.
Well, actually, just a small subset of them. To post a location pin, you need to
GET and POST your way through Udacity's iOS Networking API. This small subset
is made up of students who have successfully posted their location in their
own iOS app.
### It lets you post your own location
Since OnTheMap pulls the details from your Udacity account and geocodes
the address you enter, all you have to do is log in, enter any location
as an address and enter a link to your personal website. OnTheMap will
take care of the other details. Users can click on your location pin to
and directed to your website.
