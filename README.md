# OnTheMap
iOS app: Shows a map of Udacity students around the globe

## What is OnTheMap?
### It shows you other students' locations
OnTheMap shows you a map of all Udacity students around the world.
Well, actually, just a small subset of them. To post a location pin, you need to
GET and POST your way through Udacity's iOS Networking API. This small subset
is made up of students who have successfully posted their location in their
own iOS app.
### It lets you post your own location
Since OnTheMap pulls details from your Udacity account, 
all you have to do is log in, enter a location
as an address and enter a link to your personal website so people
can visit by clicking on your pin. OnTheMap will
take care of the rest.

Sign up for a Udacity account to get started.
